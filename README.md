# **Yle's solutions to HarvardX CS50**

## Disclaimer
Some codes is this repository needs the CS50.h library to run

## My CS50 journey
Prior to CS5, I already had study C and Python a little in my university, nonetheless my course is Eletric engeniring, so while it made my transition to CS50 more fluid, it was nonetheless a novel challenge for me.

Personally, I loved the lectures the way that is explaned, with mailboxes, lights, etc. makes really ease to understand everything, even pointers. Even the videos are usualy 1 heure long, it is yet succinct, insithful and inspiring to say the least.


## Memos about (some of) my solutions

1. **pset1/card**<br>
I found the idea behind this algorithm, the verification of a credit card, very cool. When I wrote this code I tried to make it very modular, with very small and simple functions. I really liked the result but I needed to add more comments
  
2. **pset2**<br>
In this module I learned something very cool which is how to pass parameters to the language c directly from the terminal, in addition to a better address how the characters in the ASCII table are handled

3. **pset2/readability**<br>
Seeing the code I wrote for this problem makes me very happy, because I was able to automate the testing of this algorithm very easily with the test function I created :D
  
3. **pset3/tideman**<br>
in this algorithm, I faced a very big problem, which was how to debug the code efficiently, because to run it you need a lot of parameters, and I thought that creating a test function or organizing the code to test automatically would take a lot of time, but now I see that this would be the best solution

  
4. **pset4**<br>
the problems in this section are very cool, both to program image filters and to recover files, both taught me a lot about how the computer files are, how the binaries are stored, so every minute writing this algorithm was extremely fun

5 **pset5/speller**
