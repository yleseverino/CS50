# **Yle's solutions to HarvardX CS50**

## Disclaimer
Some codes is this repository needs the CS50.h library to run

## My CS50 journey
Prior to CS50, I already had study C and Python a little in my university, nonetheless my course is Eletric engeniring, so while it made my transition to CS50 more fluid, it was nonetheless a novel challenge for me.

Personally, I loved the lectures the way that is explaned, with mailboxes, lights, etc. makes really ease to understand everything, even pointers. Even the videos are usualy 1 heure long, it is yet succinct, insithful and inspiring to say the least.


## Memos about (some of) my solutions

1. **pset1/card**<br>
I found the idea behind this algorithm, the verification of a credit card, very cool. When I wrote this code I tried to make it very modular, with very small and simple functions. I really liked the result but I needed to add more comments
  
2. **pset2**<br>
In this module I learned something very cool which is how to pass parameters to the language c directly from the terminal, in addition to a better address how the characters in the ASCII table are handled

3. **pset2/readability**<br>
Seeing the code I wrote for this problem makes me very happy, because I was able to automate the testing of this algorithm very easily with the test function I created :D
  
3. **pset3/tideman**<br>
in this algorithm, I faced a very big problem, which was how to debug the code efficiently, because to run it you need a lot of parameters, and I thought that creating a test function or organizing the code to test automatically would take a lot of time, but now I see that this would be the best solution

  
4. **pset4**<br>
the problems in this section are very cool, both to program image filters and to recover files, both taught me a lot about how the computer files are, how the binaries are stored, so every minute writing this algorithm was extremely fun

5. **pset5/speller**<br>
Wow, the David's data structure class  was very interesting, I loved every minute of it, and implementing a hash table on this problem was something I dedicated to making it as fast as possible. I used the hash djb2 algorithm that I discovered on the internet, as was hinted in the course instead of creating my own, to avoid collisions as much as possible and I tried to reduce as much as possible the use of for within my program.

6. **pset6/dna**<br>
When I finished writing the code and looked at it, I was sure, this is the most beautiful python code I've ever written !!. Besides, it was sensational learn a little about DNA and how FBI check it is done, incredible!

7. **pset7**<br>
SQL is wonderful simple as this, very simple, it goes straight to the point, I loved writing the queries in pest7 / movies, and developing the python import and reading algorithm in pset7/houses it gave me a lot of insight into how programs work and data storage, thank you very much David J. Malan.

8. **pset8/Homepage**<br>
After a little time reflecting I chose the Web path, at the beginning I confess that I almost quit, because I had a lot of work to adapt myself to program in CSS, since it was the first time that I worked with visual things, however seeing my homepage ready and after some time I managed to adapt, I still have a lot of difficulty formatting all the elements well, but I'm starting to enjoying it :D [my homepage](https://github.com/yleseverino/homepage-cs50)
